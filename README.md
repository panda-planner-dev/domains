# domains
This is a repository containing domain and problem instances for Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. At the time being (November 2020), the domains and problem instances contained in this repository were submitted for the [International Planning Competition (IPC) 2020](http://ipc2020.hierarchical-task.net), which was devoted exclusively to HTN planning. These domains and instances were not used for a range of different reasons. Please refer to the IPC booklet (to appear) for further information on these domains and problem instances.

All domains and problem instances are described in HDDL, the hierarchical domain description language [1] [(PDF)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6542/6398).

Newer domains and problem instances are likely to be added. If you have an interesting HTN domain, please contact us so we can consider adding it!

The IPC 2020 was organized by Gregor Behnke, Daniel HÃ¶ller, and Pascal Bercher. If you have any questions, please contact us!

## IPC 2023
The International Planning Competition 2023 added four more new domains that can be found in their [repo](https://github.com/ipc2023-htn/ipc2023-domains). Apart from that the IPC2023 only used domains that were already part of the IPC 2020 benchmark set.
